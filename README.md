# Collaborative Workspace
## Ideas:
  * cli for i-ching

### I-ching goals to execute:
  * The idea is to learn and use python to build a command line program.
  * Build a command line interface to make i-ching queries.
  * Creating some of simulating coin flips. Terminal or in Browser with
    JavaScript. 
  * There will be a clojure gui program that Brian has in mind.


## Web Project:
Written in Clojure

## CLI Project:
Written in Python perhaps? [This is looking like the winner.]
Other candidates - ruby? -> go? rust? Go has good CLI tools

Goals to acheive in the near future
